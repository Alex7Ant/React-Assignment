# React-Assignment
This is a React assignment whose aim is to introduce us to the application creation process using both React and Vite. The first sep is to create a react vite js app in the command terminal using the following commands:

1. npm create vite@latest greeting-cards --template react
2. cd greeting-cards
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

Next, you install Tailwind CSS and some of its dependencies and test Taliwind to check whether it's working. 
I have learned how to create a react vite js app in the command terminal, install tailwind css as well as create components in react.
